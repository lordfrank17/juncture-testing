## SoFi Stadium

The map is centered on SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, which is the location associated with the image above.  The Wikidata identifier for SoFi Stadium is `Q19520501`.  When a map location is specified using a Wikidata ID (or QID) Juncture can automatically retrieve the geographic coordinates for map centering.

An alternative to using a Wikidata identifier for map positioning is to use regular latitude and longitude coordinates.  In that approach the QID would be replaced with the coordinates `33.57,118.20`, resulting in an identical map.

Similar to the image viewer, map zooming is controlled using the buttons located in the top-left corner of the map viewer.  Panning is performed with the keyboard arrow keys or by mouse click-and-drag.
